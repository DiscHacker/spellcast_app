## A forked version of WintrCat's spellcastsolver with the following improvement
- Improved solving speed, by using multiprocessing and optimized alogorithm, overall time taken reduced by about 7 times with 2 swaps
- Implemented into app with simple GUI, guiding arrows, automatic window tracking by title

## How to use?
It's pretty much self-explanatory, you just have to run start.bat, wait for the app to finish initializing, select window that the game will be played in, though I already enabled auto track window with title contains "Discord" by default, so if you're not playing in pop-out mode, the only think you have to do is to select the number of swap, then click capture
